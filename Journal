  Learned what CTS stands for and did some python coding training.
  At the end of our class, we decided to create our own inventory system. We all did quick pitch and class member will choose 
  who to support. I am going to do Fuma's inventory which was about books. And Uzay will do my inventory for the "Erasers."
